                     <p> <span>Pune is a city located in the state of Maharashtra. Previously known as Poona, it is a
                           city situated at the junction of Mutha and Mula rivers. It is also given the name – “Queen of
                           the Deccan”. It is considered as a capital of culture for the people of Maratha.

                           This city gained recognition in the early 17th century as the capital of Bhonsle Marathas.
                           Mughals occupied this city for some time, but it was acquired back by Marathas and thus
                           remained capital for Marathas till 1817. Now, it has become a famous tourist resort which
                           offers cold weather along with various parks, hotels, religious monuments etc.</span></p>
